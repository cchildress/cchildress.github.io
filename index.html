<p>I recently ran into an issue where a Salt master running 2015.8.5 (Beryllium) was unable to query pillar information from the minion on one of my Raspberry Pis running Raspbian jessie with Salt 2014.1.13 (Hydrogen). Running "salt '*' pillar.ls" would produce the error "'pillar.ls' is not available." </p>

<p>After discussing this with the fine folks in #salt I found out that the version gap between the two is just too wide to work. I decided I'd rather update the Pi over downgrading the master and every other minion. Unfortunately the updated salt-minion package isn't available until Debian / Raspbian stretch. And even then, if there's an update to Salt it won't make it into stretch, only into sid. Given that I intend to update my master and other minions as new releases become available stretch doesn't seem like a good option.</p>

<p>This is only a temporary workaround until the official SaltStack repository is updated with armhf packages. <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/28742">See this issue for more information.</a></p>
