Running \"salt '*' pillar.ls\" would produce the error \"'pillar.ls' is not available.\" \r\n\r\nAfter discussing this with the fine folks in #salt I found out that the version gap between the two is just too wide to work. I decided I'd rather update the Pi over downgrading the master and every other minion. Unfortunately the updated salt-minion package isn't available until Debian / Raspbian stretch. And even then, if there's an update to Salt it won't make it into stretch, only into sid. Given that I intend to update my master and other minions as new releases become available stretch doesn't seem like a good option.\r\n\r\nThis is only a temporary workaround until the official SaltStack repository is updated with armhf packages.
